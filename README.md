# Pulmonary Disease Detection using Computer Vision

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my undergraduate thesis (*SB Thesis*) focused on leveraging computer vision techniques to detect pulmonary diseases from medical images, such as chest X-rays and CT scans.

## Project Overview
Lung diseases remain a major global health concern, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. This project employs deep learning models to analyze medical images and identify patterns indicative of pulmonary conditions.

### Objectives
1. Develop a computer vision pipeline for preprocessing and analyzing medical images.
2. Implement and compare the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## Repository Structure
